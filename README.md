## Public work

Modules exposed publicly are listed in [`./module`](./module) and can be
consumed as [Git
dependencies](https://clojure.org/guides/deps_and_cli#_using_git_libraries) by
[Clojure CLI](https://clojure.org/guides/deps_and_cli).

## Structure

This repository is organized and managed with [Maestro](./module/maestro), a
novel paradigm

- Whole repository is described and documented in [`deps.edn`](./deps.edn)
- Structured around small, well-scoped "modules" represented aliases
- Modules are trivial to combine, extreme flexibility
- Any module can be easily exposed as a Git dependency
- All dependencies are pinned and synced between modules
- All API documentation is generated as Markdown and kept in the repository
- Everything is automated and aims to minimize human errors
