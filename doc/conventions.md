# Conventions

Code throughout the whole repository follows the following conventions.

---

## Naming

- Keep namespace aliases as close to their actual symbol as possible
- Namespaces from this repository starts always with `protosens.`
    - And that first segment is alias as `$.` (e.g. `protosens.maestro` -> `$.maestro`)
    - Rest of the symbol is kept intact
- Pluralize with `+` instead of `s` (e.g. `items` -> `item+`)
