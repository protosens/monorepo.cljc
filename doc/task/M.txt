The `aliases` task prints required aliases and this is typically useful in
combination with Clojure CLI. This task is a shortcut directly invoking Clojure
CLI in `-M` mode.

Input is exactly the same but users can also add `--` and them provide arguments
to append.

For instance:

    bb M :some/module -- -m some.namespace 1 2 3
